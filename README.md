# lua_loader
A lua loader for stand to load 2take1 luas.

# Installation
- [Download](https://github.com/XxpichoclesxX/lua_loader/releases/download/LuaLoader/Lua.Loader.zip)
- Drag "lib" and "2Take1 Lua Loader.lua" into your `%appdata%\Stand\Lua` Scripts folder

# By Me
I added some native invokes and tried to fix some bugs at stand natives, next i will try to update to a newest native so it can work better with no bugs.
Btw it is imposible to have a notification system like at 2take1 so please be patient and has the original script told, any contribution is apreciated.
