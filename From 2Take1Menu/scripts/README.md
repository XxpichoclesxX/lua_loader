This is just a dump of a select few 2take1 lua scripts.

- [2Take1Script](https://github.com/DemonKiya/2Take1Script-Revive) - we recommend using the files from this repository instead of the official download
- [Meteor](https://github.com/RulyPancake/Meteor) - they added a check for the lua loader in 1.6.1 which we immediately circumvented but caution with newer versions is advised
